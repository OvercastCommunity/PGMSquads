# PGMSquads

This is a plugin with a default simple implementation of squads for PGM. It has simple commands for squads (commonly refered to as parties), eg: party create|invite|accept|deny|list|kick|disband.

# Running

## Prerequisites:
[PGM #1136](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/pull/1136) or later is required for this to work.

# End Goal

The goal is for this functionality to make it into [Community](https://github.com/PGMDev/Community) however that has some blockers ATM.
 - https://github.com/PGMDev/Community/pull/34 to be merged first for cloud support
 - A bit of extra effor to better integrate text translations (which PGMSquads rips off of PGM) into community (which currently has no support).
